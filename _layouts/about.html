          I work as a senior software engineer and engineering lead at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>.<br><br>

          In my time at Khan Academy, I've hopped around the stack, contributing to our mobile native (mostly Android), web, and mobile web products, and writing code across the front-end (React et al) and back-end (Python on App Engine). Today, I help lead the Independent Learning team, which focuses on self-directed learning on Khan Academy.<br><br>

          Before joining Khan Academy, I studied Computer Science at Princeton University, graduating in June 2015 as the student in top academic standing in my major. In my four years at Princeton, I interned as a software engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> and (surprise) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>.<br><br>

          My academic interests have shifted over time, from functional programming (I've done research under <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/">Professor David Walker</a>), to machine learning, to computational linguistics (my senior thesis on noun compounds was advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiane_Fellbaum">Professor Christiane Fellbaum</a>).<br><br>

          I try to write, though I don't publish as often as I'd like. My technical blog posts have been featured in Python Weekly, JavaScript Weekly, on the front page of Hacker News, and elsewhere.<br>
