          <h1>About</h1>

          I work as a software engineer on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a> mobile team, with a focus on <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.khanacademy.android">Android</a>.<br><br>

          Before that, I studied Computer Science at Princeton University, graduating in June 2015.<br><br>

          In my time at school, I also interned as a software engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>. In those stints, I mostly worked with JavaScript, but also wrote production Python. Today, it's a lot of Java.<br><br>

          My academic interests have shifted over time, from functional programming (I've done research under <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/">Professor David Walker</a>), to machine learning, to computational linguistics (my senior thesis on noun compounds was advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiane_Fellbaum">Professor Christiane Fellbaum</a>).<br><br>

          I like to write. My technical blog posts have been featured in Python Weekly, JavaScript Weekly, on the front page of Hacker News, and elsewhere.<br><br>

          I try to be active on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/crm416">Twitter</a>.
