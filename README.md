Personal blog of Charlie Marsh, deployed @ [crmarsh.com](crmarsh.com).

The pre-compiled Jekyll source can be found in the [blog](http://www.github.com/crm416/blog) repository, with the compiled source remaining in the GitHub static hosting repo due to [disabling of Jekyll plugins](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/325).
