# Technologies I've Used

In Summer 2013, I decided to drop my current blogging framework and roll my own static site from scratch. This would give me more flexibility in how I laid things out and, equally importantly, a bunch of much-needed experience in (front-end) web development.

This site is primarly built upon [Syndicate](https://github.com/shbhrsaha/syndicate): a light-weight tool for producing static blogs built by my friend [Shu](http://www.princeton.edu/~saha/), to which I've also contributed.

Other technologies that I've used here-or-there include:
- [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) for its fluid layout.
- [google-code-prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) for code syntax highlighting.
- [csscss](http://zmoazeni.github.io/csscss/) for identifying redundancies in my stylesheets.
- [helium-css](https://github.com/geuis/helium-css) for identifying unused CSS styles.
- [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/) for its static content CDN hosting.
