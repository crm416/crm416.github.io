# type blog

Source code for my personal blog, deployed @ [crmarsh.com](http://www.crmarsh.com).

## N.B.

I've maintained this blog for a number of years, since I first deployed it as a college student.

At the time, I knew very little about building software -- it was one of the first things I'd ever shipped, and I learned a lot in the process. I'm proud of what I was able to put together. But for the onlookers, note the implication that the code in this repo is extremely dated and fairly sloppy. I clean things up opportunistically, and I have ambitions to rewrite the site with more modern technologies and best practices in-mind -- but in the meantime, beware the duct tape and glue.
