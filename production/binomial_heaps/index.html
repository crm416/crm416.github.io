<h2>Merge Better</h2>

<p>The other day, I was introduced to a really cool data structure: the binomial heap. You might be familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap">binary heaps</a>, which use a binary tree to keep items in heap order; but binomial heaps are a little more obscure. As you would expect, they too retain heap order and are often used in implementing priority queues. However, the advantage of a binomial heap is that it supports <strong>log(n) merging</strong> given two binomial heaps.</p>

<p>This table sums it up nicely:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcxor7lB9f1rzq63x.png"></p>

<p>In short: <strong>with a binomial heap, you earn faster merging, but give up the O(1) find-min of a binary heap</strong>.</p>

<h2>How It Works: Binomial Trees</h2>

<p>A binomial <em>heap</em> is made up of a list of binomial <em>trees</em>, so we’ll first discuss the latter structure, which I find to be the particularly ingenious component. A binomial tree is a recursive data structure: a tree of degree zero is just a single node and a tree of degree k is two trees of degree k-1, connected.</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>A tree of degree 1 is just two nodes, i.e., two trees of degree 0.</span></li>
<li><span>A tree of degree 2 is four nodes, i.e., two trees of degree 1 (or two trees of two trees of degree zero = four nodes).</span></li>
<li><span>A tree of degree 3…</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a visual representation:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcxot8jU371rzq63x.png"></p>

<p>The great thing about a binomial tree is that we can merge two binomial trees of the same degree in constant time to produce a binomial tree of degree one higher! This is relatively straightforward when viewed in the context of the list above: if we have two trees of degree 2, we can just connect them and call it a tree of degree 3.</p>

<h2>So What’s a Binomial Heap?</h2>

<p>As stated above, a binomial heap is just a list of binomial trees. How many binomial trees, you ask? Well, assume we have n items; recall that any decimal number n can be expressed with a unique binary representation; note that a binomial tree of degree k has 2^k items; thus, for a binomial heap with n items, we can use a binomial tree of degree k for every position in n’s binary representation in which we see a 1 (rather than a 0). That was kind of verbose, so here’s an example:</p>

<p>If we have a heap with 13 items, we can express this in binary as 1101. This would translate to a binary tree of degree 3, a tree of degree 2, and a tree of degree 0 (with 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 1 items respectively = 13 total items).</p>

<h2>Merging With Binomial Heaps</h2>

<p>We can use the binary analogy to explain the Log N merge operation as well. Merging two binomial heaps is really just binary addition: for each digit i, if both heaps have a tree of degree i, then we merge them and carry-over the resulting tree of degree i + 1, carrying this process through. Since each merge is constant, and heaps of N items have at most Log N binary digits, we’re performing Log N constant-time tree merges for our heap merge—this gives us the Log N merge operation we were looking for.</p>

<h2>Beyond merging: insert, find-min, etc.</h2>

<p>The other operations are not too difficult to surmise. To insert, we can just merge two heaps: the original heap into which we want to insert, and a heap of a single item (the item we want to insert). Since merge is Log N, insert will be Log N as well.</p>

<p>Find-min is the operation in which a binomial heap loses out to a binary heap. Our heap of N items can have at most Log N binary trees. Each of these trees individually is heap-ordered, but we have no guarantee on the ordering of the trees themselves with respect to each other.</p>

<p>For example: we might have one tree whose root element is 5 and every element below the root is &lt; 5; and we might have another tree whose root element is 100 and every element below the root is > 100. These are valid to have in the same heap—but we have no way of knowing which tree’s root is the minimum until we’ve assessed all Log N trees that compose the heap. Therefore, we need to look at Log N items before we can return a min.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This really just skims the surface of binomial heaps—there’s still delete-min, decrease-key, etc. I’m in the process of writing an OCaml implementation of the data structure, and I’ll post here when it’s completed.</p>

<p>By the way, the diagrams above were drawn from <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/cs423/lectures/heaps-4up.pdf" title="Binomial Heaps">this presentation</a> (Princeton CS 423), which is definitely worth looking through if you need some solid visual enforcement.</p>
