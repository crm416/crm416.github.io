- name: Towards a Better Understanding of Noun Compound Interpretability
  description: In this paper, we explore the question of "What makes a noun compound interpretable?", taking a computational linguistic approach. Submitted to the Princeton Computer Science department as a senior thesis, advised by Prof. Christiane Fellbaum.

- name: An Overview of Boosting Techniques in the Online Learning Setting
  description: Boosting in the batch setting is a well-known machine learning technique with strong theoretical foundations and extensive use in practice. In this paper, we study the role of online boosting, in which we must ensemble online weak learners into a single online strong learner.

- name: An Introduction to Continuous (or Differential) Entropy
  description: Classically, Shannon entropy was formalized over discrete probability distributions. In this paper, we explore the role of entropy in the continuous domain.

- name: A Generalized Algorithm for Flow Table Optimization
  description: In this paper, we present a series of highly general algorithms for flow table optimization which are parameterized on user-provided hardware specifications. These algorithms allow programmers to implement and optimize policies on network switches regardless of the number of tables available and the type of pattern-matching performed.
